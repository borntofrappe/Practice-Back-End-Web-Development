## Preface

With this project I plan to practice with back-end, node development. As such, the front-end structure is dumbed down to be as simple as possible.

## Pages

Since the project is set up to handle basic routing, through express and ejs, a series of pages are set up. You can find them in the 'Pages' folder, to respectively display:

- a perennially visible navigation bar;

- a homepage;

- a contacts page;

- a four oh four page.
