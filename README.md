# Back End Practice

As I started to practice with back-end web development, notably with Node.js, I decided to create a new repository to track my progress with the underlying concepts.

This repo mirrors the 'Practice Front End Web Development' folder, literally for front-end practice. As I am less used with the concepts hereby discussed, progress might be more sparse then the mentioned repo.
